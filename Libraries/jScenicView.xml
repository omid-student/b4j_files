        <comment>This library lets you invoke ScenicViewer on any B4J Form to examine and play with the scenegraph.

Scenic View is a JavaFX application designed to make it simple to understand the current state of your
application scenegraph, and to also easily manipulate properties of the scenegraph without having to keep
editing your code. This library requires v1.3.0.

ScenicView.jar v1.3.0 can be downloaded from the &lt;ScenicView Home Page|http://fxexperience.com/scenic-view&lt;/link&gt;.
A help page for ScenicView may also accessed from that link.

Include a reference to jScenicView in your Libs tab, then only two lines of code are required.
